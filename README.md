## üèó Architecture

### üß† Memory Management System

The application uses a sophisticated **three-tier memory system**:

1. **Global Memory**
   - Maintains context across the entire application.
   - Stores **Life Coach** conversations and overall user patterns.
   - Implemented using Firebase with local storage fallback.
   - Reference: `enhancedMemoryService.ts`.

2. **Task-Specific Memory**
   - Dedicated memory for each task's context and AI interactions.
   - Maintains task breakdown, progress, and related conversations.
   - Cross-references **Global Memory** for relevant insights.
   - Uses **thread-based organization with unique IDs**.

3. **Cross-Context Awareness**
   - AI maintains awareness between **tasks and Life Coach**.
   - Summarizes and shares relevant information across contexts.
   - Uses **enhanced prompts** that include broader conversation history.
   - Implements **caching** for performance optimization.

### üîß Core Components

1. **Task Management**
   - `TaskList`: Main task overview and organization.
   - `TaskDetail`: Individual task view with AI assistance.
   - `TaskBreakdown`: AI-generated step-by-step guidance.
   - **Smart prioritization** based on user patterns.

2. **Life Coach Interface**
   - AI-powered **coach with full context awareness**.
   - Personalized advice based on user profile.
   - **Task-aware guidance** and prioritization help.
   - Maintains **conversation history** for continuity.

3. **Memory Settings**
   - **User interface for managing conversation history**.
   - **Thread-based organization of memories**.
   - Ability to **edit or clear specific memories**.
   - Controls for **memory persistence preferences**.

### üìå State Management

1. **Context Providers**
   - `TaskContext`: Manages task state and operations.
   - `AppStateContext`: Handles UI state and modals.
   - `UserContext`: Maintains user preferences and profile.

2. **Storage Layer**
   - **Firebase integration** for cloud storage.
   - **Local storage fallback** for offline functionality.
   - **Memory caching** for performance optimization.
   - **Automatic synchronization** when online.
